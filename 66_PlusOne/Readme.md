# 66 Plus one
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=programming-skills

My 1st try (03.10.2024) was okay.
My idea: The idea is easy is to check add 1 it would have carry or not, and count from behind.
1. I add 1 to the last digit and check it has carry or not.
2. do this one by one from the digits
3. if the last one also carry, then we have to add one more value at the beginning.

It reminded me of Prob 2 about big number store

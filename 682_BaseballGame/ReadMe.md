# 682 Baseball Game
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/baseball-game/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=programming-skills
My 1st try (09.10.2024) was okay.
My idea: Very easy problem, just go through each element in the list and follow the statement to write the condition.

The recommended solution use stack. I'm not that interested in, but still can read it once.

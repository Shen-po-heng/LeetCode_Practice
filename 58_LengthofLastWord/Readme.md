# 58 Lenght of Last Word
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/description/?source=submission-ac
My 1st try (07.10.2024) was okay.
My idea: spilt the string with blank and store them into a vector, and return the last word of string.

My solution was okay, but I saw the recommended solutions. I think it more easier to only count the index of the last word, and save more execution time.

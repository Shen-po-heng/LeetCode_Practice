# Merge Sorted Array
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

My 1st try (30.09.2024) was okay.
My idea: 
1. Create another vector num3 (or maybe dynamic array in other programming language), and copy num1 
(because of the description of the problem)
2. Easy idea: compare the number in num3 and num2 one by one, and store them into num1 one by one
(Consider maybe the vector will be empty at any time)

I found my solution is same as solution 2 in their recommondation.

1st solution I just saw is too cheating, but much simple, put everything into the list, and call the function sort.

3rd recommended solution seems to be a medium solution, and I will read it later.

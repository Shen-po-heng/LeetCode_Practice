# 100. Same Tree

Question description:https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

My 1st try (16.10.2024) was okay.

My idea:just do a traveral -> my way is preorder to check every value of nodes at the same positions between both tree.
If their child should be the same, so just do recursion of their children.

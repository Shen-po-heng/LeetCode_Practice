# 121 Best Time to buy and sell stock
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

My 1st try (03.10.2024) was okay.
My idea: first of all, I think its intution is brute solution and the time complexity would be n^2. Thus, I thought about other solution.
I tried to find the minmun value which is time to buy, and try to find the maximum difference after it.
1. set up min at the first price, and declare a variable for profit record
2. run though prices one by one by the idea I just mentioned.

1st try on 03.10.2024 was okay, and it's same as recommended solution.

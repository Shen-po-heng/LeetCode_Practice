# 125 Valid Palindrome
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

My 1st try (04.10.2024) was okay.
My idea: it mentioned ascll code so I just remove all blank and consider those number and alphabet to copy them and to compare them.
1. declare a string type of variable to copy a whole string with only aplhanumeric characters
2. compare them in a string from left and right

But after I checked the recommended solution, actually there is built-in function called "isalnum()" and it looks much clear 
and also other built in function  string.resize(), reverse_copy();

```
 string filtered_string, reversed_string;

        for (auto ch : s) {
            if (isalnum(ch)) filtered_string += tolower(ch);
        }

        reversed_string.resize(filtered_string.size());
        reverse_copy(filtered_string.begin(), filtered_string.end(),
                     reversed_string.begin());

```

another solution is also good to be learnt, we actaully, can put two variable into loop:

```
for (int i = 0, j = s.size() - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
            while (i < j && !isalnum(s[i])) i++;
            while (i < j && !isalnum(s[j])) j--;

            if (tolower(s[i]) != tolower(s[j])) return false;
        }
```

# 26 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150
My 1st try (01.10.2024) was okay.
My idea: used two pointer and focus when should the previous pointer change with the browsing point on nums

1. Declare a pointer and return counter 

2. Go through each value by one pointer, and only move forward when the value by previous pointer different from the browsing pointer 

The suggested solution is same idea.

# Find the Difference
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=programming-skills
My 1st try (30.09.2024) was okay.
My idea: is a bit similiar to prob 389 (Find the Difference). I used sort function and run through them one by one.

1. Put two into sort function to rearrange their order
2. Compare them one by one and return 

Still can consider hashmap and bit operation (other days...)

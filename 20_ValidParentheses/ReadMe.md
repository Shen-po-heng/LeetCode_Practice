# 20. Valid Parentheses
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150
My 1st try (10.10.2024) was okay.
My idea: very easy, just go through the string, and store them like stack.
I use vector to implement this. I think the point of using Queue and Vector to implement stack, it's to store and pop out thing from the tail of list.

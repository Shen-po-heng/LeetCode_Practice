# Add Two Numbers
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

My 1st try (23.09.2024) was not a good solution.
My idea: 1. get 2 numbers from the digits of 2 list
         2. sum up 2 numbers 
         3. and, store the sum into the returned list

What problem? If the number is too big then, that can't be stored.

# 709 To Lower Case
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/to-lower-case/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=programming-skills
My 1st try (07.10.2024) was okay.
My idea: I just run through each one and add 32 (if they are upper case) by ascll code

It can be also implemented by hash table.

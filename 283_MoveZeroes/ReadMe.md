# 283 ove Zeroes
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=programming-skills

My 1st try (03.10.2024) was okay.
My idea: Use another pointer to run through and swap the zero with non zero

I found my solution is similar as solution 2,3 in their recommondation.
Recommonded solution 1 is not really cool, because they already suggested not to use another array in their note.

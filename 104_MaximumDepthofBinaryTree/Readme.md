# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150
My 1st try (10.10.2024) was okay.
My idea: the logic is just as the code, very simple by recursive, and it is also kind of an implementation of DFS.

Rrecommended solution also included this, but also consider Queue to practice BFS (level order) to practice.

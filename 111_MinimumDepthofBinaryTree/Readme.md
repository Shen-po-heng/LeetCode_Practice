# 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=programming-skills
My 1st try (10.11.2024) was  okay.
My idea: it's very similar to 104, but you have to be careful to notice, it's to count path with a leaf instead of null. So depth = 1 only happen, there is only one root. depth = 2 only happens one root with two child.

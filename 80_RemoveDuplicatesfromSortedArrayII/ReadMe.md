# 80 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
Question description:https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150 

My 1st try (01.10.2024) was okay.
My idea: (Almost same as Prob 26 just add one more variable to count the times of apperance)
used two pointer and focus when should the previous pointer change with the browsing point on nums

1. Declare a pointer and return counter 

2. Go through each value by one pointer, and only move forward when the value by previous pointer different from the browsing pointer 
(But permit one more copy, please comare this with Prob 26, and you will know what I said.)

I haven't studied the suggested solution for this prob.

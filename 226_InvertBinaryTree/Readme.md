# 226. Invert Binary Tree
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=programming-skills
My 1st try (10.11.2024) was  okay.
My idea: simple thinking to use swap to change the value of two child, and do recursion so put their child into invert function. Although invert function will return root, we don't have to declare any variable to use function.

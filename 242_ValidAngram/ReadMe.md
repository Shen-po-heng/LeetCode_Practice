# 242 Valid Angram
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=programming-skills
My 1st try (01.10.2024) was okay.
My idea: the intution is very clear to use sorting method and to run through them one by one

1. Put two into sort function to rearrange their order
2. Compare them one by one and return 

Still can consider hashmap and bit operation (other days...)

I also see the solution can use counter by alphabet.

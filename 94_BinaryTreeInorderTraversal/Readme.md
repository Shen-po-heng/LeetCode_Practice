# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=programming-skills
My 1st try (11.10.2024) was  okay.
My idea: very simple, just do inorder travesal, so must remember what is preorder, inorder, postorder, becasue it is pretty basic way to traveral in tree.

The recommended solution has 2 other ways, one is using stack, one is Morris Traversal (I haven't heard this before. I think I will read it later carefully.)

# 392 Is Subsequence
Question description: https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

My idea: easy problem, just go through each element in the t and chech s has it or not. (with 2 pointer)

The recommended solution looks quite complicated, they worte very long.
I might choose one day to read....maybe...
